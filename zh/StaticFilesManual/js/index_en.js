The triangles are also collected together into a single array of integers; the integers are taken in groups of three from the start of this array, so elements 0, 1 and 2 define the first triangle, 3, 4 and 5 define the second, and so on.

To allow the object to be shaded correctly for lighting, a normal vector must be supplied for each vertex. A normal is a vector that points outward, perpendicular to the mesh surface at the position of the vertex it is associated with. During the shading calculation, each vertex normal is compared with the direction of the incoming light, which is also a vector. If the two vectors are perfectly aligned, then the surface is receiving light head-on at that point and the full brightness of the light will be used for shading. A light coming exactly side-on to the normal vector will give no illumination to the surface at that position. Typically, the light will arrive at an angle to the normal and so the shading will be somewhere in between full brightness and complete darkness, depending on the angle.",6],["Since the mesh is made up of triangles, it may seem that the normals at corners will simply be perpendicular to the plane of their triangle. However, normals are actually interpolated across the triangle to give the surface direction of the intermediate positions between the corners. If all three normals are pointing in the same direction then the triangle will be uniformly lit all over. The effect of having separate triangles uniformly shaded is that the edges will be very crisp and distinct. This is exactly what is required for a model of a cube or other sharp-edged solid but the interpolation of the normals can be used to create smooth shading to approximate a curved surface.",6],["To get crisp edges, it is necessary to double up vertices at each edge since both of the two adjacent triangles will need their own separate normals.",6],["For curved surfaces, vertices will usually be shared along edges but a bit of intuition is often required to determine the best direction for the shared normals. A normal might simply be the average of the normals of the planes of the surrounding triangles. However, for an object like a sphere, the normals should just be pointing directly outward from the sphere's centre.",6],["By calling Mesh.RecalculateNormals, you can get Unity to work out the normals' directions for you by making some assumptions about the \"meaning\" of the mesh geometry; it assumes that vertices shared between triangles indicate a smooth surface while doubled-up vertices indicate a crisp edge. While this is not a bad approximation in most cases, RecalculateNormals will be tripped up by some texturing situations where vertices must be doubled even though the surface is smooth.",6],["Texturing",6],["In addition to the lighting, a model will also typically make use of texturing to create fine detail on its surface. A texture is a bit like an image printed on a stretchable sheet of rubber. For each mesh triangle, a triangular area of the texture image is defined and that texture triangle is stretched and \"pinned\" to fit the mesh triangle. To make this work, each vertex needs to store the coordinates of the image position that will be pinned to it. These coordinates are two dimensional and scaled to the 0..1 range (0 means the bottom/left of the image and 1 means the right/top). To avoid confusing these coordinates with the Cartesian coordinates of the 3D world, they are referred to as U and V rather than the more familiar X and Y, and so they are commonly called UV coordinates.",6],["Like normals, texture coordinates are unique to each vertex and so there are situations where you need to double up vertices purely to get different UV values across an edge. An obvious example is where two adjacent triangles use discontinuous parts of the texture image (eyes on a face texture, say). Also, most objects that are fully enclosed volumes will need a \"seam\" where an area of texture wraps around and joins together. The UV values at one side of the seam will be different from those at the other side.",6],["Android Scripting",7],["Most features of the Android devices are exposed through the Input and Handheld classes.

For example, you may create your animation in 3ds Max or Maya at a frame rate of 60 frames per second (fps). When importing the animation in Unity, this frame rate will be read by the importer, so the data of the imported animation is also sampled at 60 fps.",22],["However, games typically run at a variable frame rate. The frame rate may be higher on some computers than on others, and it may also vary from one second to the next based on the complexity of the view the camera is looking at at any given moment. Basically this means that we can make no assumptions about the exact frame rate the game is running at. What this means is that even if an animation is authored at 60 fps, it may be played back at a different framerate, such as 56.72 fps, or 83.14 fps, or practically any other value.",22],["As a result, Unity must sample an animation at variable framerates, and cannot guarantee the framerate for which it was originally designed. Fortunately, animations for 3D computer graphics do not consist of discrete frames, but rather of continuous curves. These curves can be sampled at any point in time, not just at those points in time that correspond to frames in the original animation. In fact, if the game runs at a higher frame rate than the animation was authored with, the animation will actually look smoother and more fluid in the game than it did in the animation software.",22],["For most practical purposes, you can ignore the fact that Unity samples animations at variable framerates. However, if you have gameplay logic that relies on animations that animate transforms or properties into very specific configurations, then you need to be aware that the re-sampling takes place behind the scenes. For example, if you have an animation that rotates an object from 0 to 180 degrees over 30 frames, and you want to know from your code when it has reached half way there, you should not do it by having a conditional statement in your code that checks if the current rotation is 90 degrees. Because Unity samples the animation according to the variable frame rate of the game, it may sample it when the rotation is just below 90 degrees, and the next time right after it reached 90 degrees. If you need to be notified when a specific point in an animation is reached, you should use an AnimationEvent instead.",22],["Note also that as a consequence of the variable framerate sampling, an animation that is played back using WrapMode.Once may not be sampled at the exact time of the last frame. In one frame of the game the animation may be sampled just before the end of the animation, and in the next frame the time can have exceeded the length of the animation, so it is disabled and not sampled further.

If rotations larger than 180 degrees are desired, additional keys must be placed in between. When using Quaternion interpolation, changing the keys or tangents of one curve may also change the shapes of the other two curves, since all three curves are created from the internal Quaternion representation.

Not all computers are made equal, and different hardware configurations will run Unity games with varying performance. Therefore, physics must be calculated independently of the game's frame rate. Physics calculations like collision detection and Rigidbody movement are performed in discrete fixed time steps that are not dependent on frame rate.

For example, the frame rate can drop due to an appearance of many game onscreen, or because the user launched another application in the background.",184],["Here's how the fixed time step is calculated. Before every frame is drawn onscreen, Unity advances the fixed time by fixed delta time and performs physics calculations until it reaches the current time. This directly correlates to the Fixed Timestep property. The smaller the value of Fixed Timestep, the more frequently physics will be calculated. The number of Fixed frames per second can be calculated by dividing 1 by Fixed Timestep.

A collider, which is invisible, need not be the exact same shape as the object's mesh and in fact, a rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. The simplest (and least processor-intensive) colliders and the so-called primitive collider types. In 3D, these are the Box Collider, Sphere Collider and Capsule Collider. In 2D, you can use the Box Collider 2D and Circle Collider 2D. Any number of these can be added to a single object to create compound colliders. With careful positioning and sizing, compound colliders can often approximate the shape of an object quite well while keeping a low processor overhead. Further flexibility can be gained by having additional colliders on child objects (eg, boxes can be rotated relative to the local axes of the parent object). However, you should be sure that there is only one Rigidbody and this should be placed on the root object in the hierarchy.",198],["There are some cases, however, where even compound colliders are not accurate enough. In 3D, you can use Mesh Colliders to match the shape of the object's mesh exactly. In 2D, the Polygon Collider 2D will generally not match the shape of the sprite graphic perfectly but you can refine the shape to any level of detail you like. These colliders are much more processor-intensive than primitive types, however, so use them sparingly to maintain good performance. Also, a mesh collider will normally be unable to collide with another mesh collider (ie, nothing will happen when they make contact). You can get around this in some cases by marking the mesh collider as Convex in the inspector. This will generate the collider shape as a \"convex hull\" which is like the original mesh but with any undercuts filled in. The benefit of this is that a convex mesh collider can collide with other mesh colliders so you may be able to use this feature when you have a moving character with a suitable shape. However, a good general rule is to use mesh colliders for scene geometry and approximate the shape of moving objects using compound primitive colliders.",198],["Colliders can be added to an object without a Rigidbody component to create floors, walls and other motionless elements of a scene. These are referred to as static colliders. In general, you should not reposition static colliders by changing the Transform position since this will impact heavily on the performance of the physics engine. Colliders on an object that does have a Rigidbody are known as dynamic colliders.

Although the shape of colliders is not deformed during collisions, their friction and bounce can be configured using Physics Materials. Getting the parameters just right can involve a bit of trial and error but an ice material, for example will have zero (or very low) friction and a rubber material with have high friction and near-perfect bounciness. See the reference pages for Physic Material and Physics Material 2D for further details on the available parameters.

Consequently, static colliders should not be disabled/enabled, moved or scaled during gameplay. If you do change a static collider then this will result in extra internal recomputation by the physics engine which causes a major drop in performance. Worse still, the changes can sometimes leave the collider in an undefined state that produces erroneous physics calculations. For example a raycast against an altered Static Collider could fail to detect it, or detect it at a random position in space. Furthermore, Rigidbodies that are hit by a moving static collider will not necessarily be \"awoken\" and the static collider will not apply any friction. For these reasons, only colliders that are Rigidbodies should be altered. If you want a collider object that is not affected by incoming rigidbodies but can still be moved from a script then you should attach a Kinematic Rigidbody component to it rather than no Rigidbody at all.",198],["Rigidbody Collider",198],["This is a GameObject with a Collider and a normal, non-kinematic Rigidbody attached.

You can move a kinematic rigidbody object from a script by modifying its Transform Component but it will not respond to collisions and forces like a non-kinematic rigidbody.

An example of this is a sliding door that should normally act as an immovable physical obstacle but can be opened when necessary. Unlike a static collider, a moving kinematic rigidbody will apply friction to other objects and will \"wake up\" other rigidbodies when they make contact.",198],["Even when immobile, kinematic rigidbody colliders have different behavior to static colliders.

This means that games with simple mouse interaction can often work transparently between the desktop and mobile platforms.

Likewise, it might be possible to use a two-finger tap on a mobile to replace a right button click on the desktop.

In cases like this, the input API calls are usually fairly easy to replace, so the accelerometer input might be replaced by keystrokes, say. However, it may be necessary to recalibrate inputs or even vary the difficulty of the game to take account of the different input method. Tilting a device is slower and eventually more strenuous than pressing keys and may also make it harder to concentrate on the display.

Then, some time later, the Garbage Collector runs, and it removes anything in memory that is not referenced anywhere.

With these issues in mind, it should be apparent that performance will suffer if you allocate pools that are too large or keep them active when the objects they contain will not be needed for some time. Furthermore, many types of objects don't lend themselves well to object pooling. For example, the game may include spell effects that persist for a considerable time or enemies that appear in large numbers but which are only killed gradually as the game progresses.

There may be concerns other than time too. At night, you might prefer to avoid walking down a dark alleyway and take a longer but well-lit route for safety. You can understand both these situations by noting that each step along a path has a certain cost associated with it.

However, the behaviour might sometimes be \"rational\" but unrealistic. A car can be made to favour roads by assigning them a low cost, but it should never normally drive through somebody's garden just to avoid a hairpin bend.

The reachable area is defined by the polygons of the mesh, while the possible paths through the mesh are conveniently broken down into hops between adjacent polygons. In theory, the same mesh that is used for the floor graphics can also be used for navigation. In practice, the graphical mesh is usually too detailed and consequently inefficient for navigation. For this and other reasons, an AI system usually supplements the floor mesh with a simpler, invisible mesh known as a navigation mesh (or \"navmesh\" for short).

For example, clients do not have the possibility of cheating by telling the server (and thereby other clients) that an enemy has been killed, since they don't get to make that decision by themselves.

If the player presses a control to move forward and it takes a tenth of a second for the response to return from the server then the delay will be perceptible to the player.

The essence of this technique is that the client is allowed to update its own local version of the game state but it must be able to receive corrections from the server's authoritative version where necessary. Typically, this should only be used for simple game actions and not significant logical changes to game state. For example, it would be unwise to report to a player that an enemy has been killed only for the server to override this decision.",404],["Since client-side prediction is an advanced subject, we don't attempt to cover it in this guide but books and web resources are available if you want to investigate it further.",404],["An authoritative server has a greater processing overhead than a non-authoritative one.

Simply explained, the private address goes through a local router which translates the address into a public address. By doing this, many machines with private addresses can use a single public IP address to communicate with the internet. This is fine until someone elsewhere on the internet wants to initiate contact with one of the private addresses. The communication must happen via the public address of the router, which must then pass the message on to the private address. A technique called NAT punchthrough uses a shared server known as a facilitator to mediate communication in such a way that the private address can be reached from the public address. This works by having the private address first contact the facilitator, which \"punches\" a hole through the local router. The facilitator can now see the public IP address and port which the private address is using. Using this information, any machine on the internet can now connect directly with the otherwise unreachable private address.

An external firewall, by contrast, is not under the control of the users.

Our testing suggests that it generally works in practice but there doesn't appear to be any formal research that confirms this finding.",404],["The connectivity issues just mentioned affect servers and clients differently. Client requests involve only outgoing network traffic which is relatively straightforward. If the client has a public address then this almost always works since outgoing traffic is typically only blocked on corporate networks that impose severe access restrictions. If the client has a private address it can connect to all servers except servers with private addresses which cannot do NAT punchthrough (more will be said about this later). The server end is more complicated because the server needs to be able to accept incoming connections from unknown sources. With a public address, the server needs to have the game port open to the internet (ie, not blocked by a firewall). or else it cannot accept any connections from clients and is thus unusable. If the server has a private address it must be able to do NAT punchthrough to allow connections and clients must also permit NAT punchthrough in order to connect to it.",404],["Unity provides tools to test all these different connectivity situations.

This is often the best synchronization mode to use when objects change state very frequently and the effect of a missed update is very short-lived. However, you should bear in mind the amount of data that might be sent during each update. For example, synchronizing a Transform involves transmitting nine float values (three Vector3s with three floats each), which equates to 36 Bytes per update. If the server is running with eight clients and using the default update frequency then it will receive 4,320 KBytes/s (8*36*15) or 34.6Kbits/s and transmit 30.2 KBytes/s (8*7*36*15) or 242Kbits/s.

An example of this is where animations are synchronized. If an Animation component is observed by a Network View then its properties will be synchronized exactly, so the frames of animation will appear exactly the same on all clients. Although this may be desirable in some cases, typically it will be enough for the character to be seen as walking, running, jumping, etc. The animations can thus be crudely synchronized simply by sending an integer value to denote which animation sequence to play.

Since the string gets longer with increasing values of i, the amount of heap space being consumed also increases and so it is easy to use up hundreds of bytes of free heap space each time this function is called.
